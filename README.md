For our project, we wanted to create a game with Unity. We were all (mostly) new to Unity, so we decided to take this as an opportunity to learn more about game design and Unity in general. We decided that we wanted to create a scooter racing game where the user could not bump into anything or anybody, as UCR had sent out an email recently warning us about how people were being reckless with users. We thought this game contributed to "social impact" (one of the tracks available on this hackathon) as it promotes carefulness and safety. We decided to come up with a story where the objective was to deliver supplies to people on campus, as this further emphasized the "social impact" aspect that we wanted to go for with this app. Here is our story.

Anna is a UCR student who wants to do good for her community. She recently got a job delivering supplies to people on campus, such as more books for the library, period products for female students, and food for people who need it. Amara recently got an electric scooter, which has made her job much easier. However, the dean issued an announcement recently talking about how people need to be more careful on their scooters, and that if someone is seen being reckless with their scooter, it will be confiscated. In this game, your job is to get Anna to deliver the supplies to their respective people without crashing the scooter. If you crash the scooter, the game is over.
